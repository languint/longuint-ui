import { Card, Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components'

<Card title="Installation" icon="rocket">
    <Tabs>
        <TabItem label="npm">
            ```sh
            npm i @rbxts/longuint-ui
            ```
        </TabItem>

## Creating a UI

```tsx
import React, { StrictMode } from "@rbxts/react";
import { App } from "./app";
import { createRoot } from "@rbxts/react-roblox";
import { Players } from "@rbxts/services";

const rootInstance = new Instance('ScreenGui')
rootInstance.IgnoreGuiInset = true
rootInstance.Name = "root"
rootInstance.Parent = Players.LocalPlayer.WaitForChild("PlayerGui")

const root = createRoot(rootInstance)

root.render(
    <StrictMode>
        <RootProvider options={{pallete: Palletes.Default}}>
            <App />
        </RootProvider>
    </StrictMode>
)
```

In this example:

1. We create a ScreenGui instance named "root" and attach it to the PlayerGui.
2. createRoot() initializes the root for rendering.
3. `<RootProvider />` wraps your application components, providing them with necessary context (e.g., default palette options).
4. `<App />` represents your main application component, which you'll define according to your UI requirements.
This setup initializes your longuint-ui environment, allowing you to build and render your UI components effectively.
